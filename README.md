# AnalyzeSpikes
This repository contains two Matlab scripts that I used for data analysis of simulations of the visual cortex
RasterPlotterBeta.m takes the data folder as an input a produces a raster plot of significant spiking activity.
importAndCountSpikes.m takes the file LFP5.central.column00 as input, performs guassian filtering and outputs a plot that includes the spiking activity and the count of significant spikes in the period of time in which the the region is stimulated
